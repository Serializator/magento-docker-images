# Magento Docker Image
I couldn't really find what I needed. A Docker image which was kept up-to-date and included everything necessary to be used in a CI / CD process.  

I decided to create a repository which uses GitHub Actions to periodically build and push Docker images based on the latest supported Magento versions.
